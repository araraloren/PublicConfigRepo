error:ERROR_TRANSACTIONMANAGER_NOT_FOUND
number:6718
comment:The specified TransactionManager object could not be opened, because it was not found.
error:ERROR_TRANSACTIONMANAGER_NOT_ONLINE
number:6719
comment:The object specified could not be created or opened, because its associated TransactionManager is not online. The TransactionManager must be brought fully Online by calling RecoverTransactionManager to recover to the end of its LogFile before objects in its Transaction or ResourceManager namespaces can be opened. In addition, errors in writing records to its LogFile can cause a TransactionManager to go offline.
error:ERROR_TRANSACTIONMANAGER_RECOVERY_NAME_COLLISION
number:6720
comment:The specified TransactionManager was unable to create the objects contained in its logfile in the Ob namespace. Therefore, the TransactionManager was unable to recover.
error:ERROR_TRANSACTION_NOT_ROOT
number:6721
comment:The call to create a superior Enlistment on this Transaction object could not be completed, because the Transaction object specified for the enlistment is a subordinate branch of the Transaction. Only the root of the Transaction can be enlisted on as a superior.
error:ERROR_TRANSACTION_OBJECT_EXPIRED
number:6722
comment:Because the associated transaction manager or resource manager has been closed, the handle is no longer valid.

number:6723
comment:The specified operation could not be performed on this Superior enlistment, because the enlistment was not created with the corresponding completion response in the NotificationMask.
error:ERROR_TRANSACTION_RECORD_TOO_LONG
number:6724
comment:The specified operation could not be performed, because the record that would be logged was too long. This can occur because of two conditions: either there are too many Enlistments on this Transaction, or the combined RecoveryInformation being logged on behalf of those Enlistments is too long.

error:ERROR_TRANSACTION_MUST_WRITETHROUGH
number:6729
comment:The transaction cannot be enlisted on with the specified EnlistmentMask, because the transaction has already completed the PrePrepare phase.

Enlisting for only subsequent transaction phases may still succeed.

comment:The transaction does not have a superior enlistment.
error:ERROR_HEURISTIC_DAMAGE_POSSIBLE
